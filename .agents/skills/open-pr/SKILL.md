<!-- Source: raine/workmux v0.1.271. Local customization: explicit PR workflow, scoped staging, and project commit rules. -->

Run only for an explicitly requested PR workflow. Never stage secrets or
unrelated changes, force-push, or create a PR merely because this skill is
installed. Preserve project commit conventions.

## Gather context

1. Get the base branch (usually `main` or `master`)
2. Get the diff: `git diff <base>...HEAD`
3. Get commit messages: `git log <base>...HEAD --format="%s"`
4. Read changed files to understand the broader context

## Commit uncommitted changes

1. Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes
2. Review changes and explicitly stage only task-relevant, non-secret paths.
   Inspect the staged diff and write a project-compliant message (Partners Hub:
   Conventional Commits). Ask about unrelated edits instead of committing them.
   Ensure the intended PR changes are committed before proceeding.

## Write PR description

Use this template:

```markdown
## Summary

[1-2 sentences: what this PR does and why]

## Changes

- [Key change 1]
- [Key change 2]
- [Key change 3]

## Testing

[How you verified it works]
```

Guidelines:

- Lead with a concise summary of what the PR does
- Explain the "why" before the "how"
- Use the conversation context to inform the description
- Include before/after comparisons for UI or performance changes
- Be direct and to the point

## Create the PR

1. Write a short PR title (max 72 characters)

2. Ensure the branch is pushed:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin HEAD
   ```

3. Open PR creation in browser (do NOT create directly):
   ```bash
   gh pr create --web --title "<title>" --body "<body>"
   ```
